# DOT FILES

This is a collection of my personal configuration files for several applications.
It also includes some automation scripts in `~/.local/scripts`.

Most of the configuration files are under a directory called `HOME` in this  git
repo. This directory mimics the `$HOME`  directory.  That  means  that  you  can
simply copy the configuration files with command below:

```shell
cp -r ./HOME ~/
```

This will copy all configuration files to your home directory. 

There is also a directory called `ROOT`, which  has  the  dot  files  I  use  on
`/root` directory on remote servers via ssh.
