# DOT FILES

This is a collection of my personal configuration files for several applications, such as:

- vim
- ranger
- qutebrowser
- zsh
- i3
- alacritty
- shell

Most, if not all, configuration files are under a directory called `HOME` in this git repo. This directory mimics the `$HOME` directory. That means that you can simply copy the configuration files with command below:

```shell
cp -r './HOME/*' ~/
```

This will copy all configuration files to your home directory. 

## LICENSE

Use this repo as you wish. Do whatever you want with it.

This repo consists of digital files, which are literally sequences of 0s and 1s that a computer reads an displays to the user. Nobody can own a sequence of numbers. People can own an instance (physical representation of it) of an idea (for example, you can write ideas into paper and own the paper), but you can't own abstract things. Therefore, you don't need my permission or permission of anyone to replicate the code in this repo (the same goes for any idea/abstraction).
